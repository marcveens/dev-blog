I recently ran into an issue when developing an Azure DevOps extension. I was using the [azure-devops-extension-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-devops-extension-sdk) package get data from the Azure DevOps project I was running the extension in. I used the package in multiple files but then encountered this error in my console:

<div class="code-like">
The AzureDevOps SDK is already loaded. Only one version of this module can be loaded in a given document.
</div>

This is because, well, the SDK isn't particularly well programmed in my opinion. In the [source code](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sdk/blob/master/src/SDK.ts) of the SDK, we see this:

```typescript
const global = window as any;
if (global._AzureDevOpsSDKVersion) {
    console.error("The AzureDevOps SDK is already loaded. Only one version of this module can be loaded in a given document.");
}

global._AzureDevOpsSDKVersion = sdkVersion;
```

This means that we should actually only load the script once. Once for our whole contribution...

## Solution
My solution was to create an `SDKContext`. That's the only place I reference the `azure-devops-extension-sdk` package. Then I just simply pass the reference to all the consuming components.

```typescript
import * as SDK from 'azure-devops-extension-sdk';

type SDKContextProps = {
  SDK: typeof SDK;
};

export const SDKContext = React.createContext<SDKContextProps>({} as SDKContextProps);

export const SDKProvider: React.FC = (props) => {
  const context: SDKContextProps = {
    SDK
  };

  const initSDK = async () => {
    await SDK.init();
  };

  React.useEffect(() => {
    initSDK();
  }, []);

  return (
    <SDKContext.Provider value={context}>{props.children}</SDKContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Now you wrap your component/app in the `SDKProvider`:

```typescript
ReactDOM.render(
  <SDKProvider>
    <MyContribution />
  </SDKProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

And then you're able to consume the context wherever you like, happy days!

```typescript
export const MyContribution = () => {
  const { SDK } = React.useContext(ApiContext);

  const getConfiguration = async () => {
    const data = await SDK.getConfiguration();
    // ...
  };

  // ...
};
```
