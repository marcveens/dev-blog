Imagine this, you spent day and night working on the perfect web application. You worked together with the backend devs to craft the smoothest and most stable GraphQL endpoint there ever was. Filtering, sorting, paging, all the parts were there. New collection? No problem at all, it's added in no-time. Amazing! Until... It was decided to add a second GraphQL endpoint. Wait what, can't we add it as a collection to the current endpoint? No? But wait, we can do schema stitching, right? Right??

Well the answer was no. Here we are with 2 GraphQL endpoints that both need to be consumed simultaneously. We're using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), which by default only supports a single endpoint. Next to that, we're also using the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for converting the schema and `operations.graphql` files to Typescript types and documents. A generic, solid solution was mandatory to support both of these libs, so I went ahead and created a structure that you can also reuse in your projects. 

## Used endpoints
I created a demo application on <a href="https://github.com/marcveens/multiple-graphql-endpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. In this demo I consumed data from a free-to-use SpaceX GraphQL endpoint and a countries GraphQL endpoint.

## Consumption of data
First I want to show what I ended up with on the consumption part of the application.

As you can see, instead of the default `useQuery` hook from Apollo I now have `useSpacexQuery` and `useCountriesQuery` hooks. As you can imagine, they both fetch data from their corresponding data source. I made `useSpacexMutation` and `useCountriesMutation` available as well, I just don't use them in this example.

## Setting up Apollo clients

In <a href="https://github.com/marcveens/multiple-graphql-endpoints/blob/main/src/apollo/useApollo.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useApollo.ts</a> I made the hooks available. What I basically do, is create a generic instance of `useQuery` and inject the correct Apollo Client based on whether you want SpaceX data or Countries data.

In <a href="https://github.com/marcveens/multiple-graphql-endpoints/blob/main/src/apollo/useApolloClient.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">useApolloClient.ts</a> you can see how to return the correct GraphQL endpoint for your data. By creating 2 Apollo Clients (or more if you need them) you can use either of them in your data calls. 

Because we created the custom `useXQuery` hook, we don't ever have to think of configuring the Apollo Client again, we can just use it as easily as when you only had one `useQuery` hook. 

## GraphQL Code Generator
I use the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for generating Typescript types and documents based on a schema and `operation.grapql` files. Usually that works pretty straight forward if you only have a single endpoint. Since I have 2 of them, I simply added 2 `codegen.ts` files. 

My countries [`codegen.ts`](https://github.com/marcveens/multiple-graphql-endpoints/blob/main/src/libs/graphql/countries/codegen.ts) file responds to `operations.countries.graphql` files, and my SpaceX [`codegen.ts`](https://github.com/marcveens/multiple-graphql-endpoints/blob/main/src/libs/graphql/spacex/codegen.ts) file to `operations.spacex.graphql` files.

I found this the most straight forward solution to a sub-optimal situation. Hopefully this helps you out as well.

Cheers!
