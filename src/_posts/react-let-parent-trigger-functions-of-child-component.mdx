**`useImperativeHandle`** is the magic word. More about it later!

In React, the way of communicating between parent and child components is usually done in 2 ways:

- The parent sends `props` to the child
- The child can send data back to the parent by using callbacks

## Classic ways

An example of using `props`:

```typescript
// Parent component
const MyPage = () => {
  return <Modal open={true} title="Submit your score" />;
};

// Child component
const Modal = (props: ModalProps) => {
  const { open, title } = props;

  if (!open) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};
```

And an example of using a callback function:

```typescript
// Parent component
const MyPage = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState<boolean>(false);

  return (
    <Modal
      open={isOpen}
      title="Submit your score"
      // This is the callback function
      toggleOpen={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}
    />
  );
};

// Child component
const Modal = (props: ModalProps) => {
  const { open, title, toggleOpen } = props;

  if (!open) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <button onClick={toggleOpen}>Close</button>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};
```

## useImperativeHandle

Sometimes you encounter a situation where you have functions in the child component, that need to be called from a parent component. For example I recently encountered this when creating the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-drawio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-drawio</a> package.

The package I created contained a few functions to interact with the embedded iframe. I wanted to expose those functions to any component that would implement the `react-drawio` package.

I was looking for a solution when I stumbled upon the React <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useImperativeHandle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`useImperativeHandle`</a> hook. The React docs describe the hook like this: _`useImperativeHandle` is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a ref_.

Let me break that down a bit.

You have probably used `useRef` before to get access to the API of a certain DOM element. For example to put `.focus()` on an element, or to get a certain attribute from an element by using `getAttribute()`.

That's all good, but did you know you can use `useRef` for accessing the API of a React component?

### The magic
```typescript
// Parent component
const MyPage = () => {
  const modalRef = useRef<ModalRef>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (modalRef.current) {
      drawioRef.current.myExtraFunction();
    }
  }, [modalRef.current]);

  return (
    <Modal ref={modalRef} />
  );
};

// Child component
const Modal = forwardRef<ModalRef, ModalProps>((props, ref) => {
  const focus = () => {
      // Do something
  };

  const myExtraFunction = () => {
      // Do something
  };

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus,
    myExtraFunction
  }), []);  

  return (
    <div className="modal">
      ...
    </div>
  );
});
```

Two things to notice here.

1. I wrapped the Modal component in a React `forwardRef` function. React docs describe this function as _`forwardRef` lets your component receive a ref and forward it to a child component_.
2. I used `useRef` in the parent component which can now access both `focus` and `myExtraFunction` from the child component, because I only exposed those 2 functions.

This is _not_ a replacement for `props` or callback functions, and you might not even need it that often, but just know that it's there!

Let me know if you found this useful, or if you're already using it for other use cases!
